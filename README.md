# LSTM Neural Network for Time Series Prediction

LSTM built using the Keras Python package to predict time series steps and sequences. Includes sin wave and stock market data.

## Requirements

This is to make it available to run natively on Windows TensorFlow installations.

* Python 3.5
* TensorFlow 1.0
* Numpy 1.12.0
* Keras 1.2.2
* Matplotlib 2.0.0
